# NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions

The objective of the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions project is to identify the root cause of vehicle collisions and plotting the various contributing factors versus collisions. Plotting the number of person injured/killed, number of fatal accidents occurred divided on borough and their location mapping in NYC to provide better visualizations.

Collisions are plotted according to borough. This will help to identify the time of the day maximum number of accidents happen, the type of vehicles responsible for frequent accidents and the number of persons (Cyclist, Motorist, and Pedestrian) killed/injured in these accidents.

Matplotlib is used for plotting, Pandas, SQL are used for data querying and numpy is used for analysis. These reports/visualizations can be used by the public to see how dangerous/safe intersections are in NYC. These reports can be used by the local authorities to alert the commuters by including sign boards.
